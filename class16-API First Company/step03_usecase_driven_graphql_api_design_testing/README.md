## User Centric Mutations

## Panacloud API Design Process

Each and every step in our application design process is ‘user-oriented’: 

### Use Cases: 

In this document we will specify ‘What are the actions done by the user?’, ‘What the Actors see in a system?’ and ‘How the system responds?’.

## Wireframes (Use Case Driven): 

From these Use Cases we are developing the Wireframes. A website/app wireframe, also known as a page schematic or screen blueprint, is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website.  Wireframes are created for the purpose of arranging elements to best accomplish a particular purpose. We will identify which screens as are addressing which use case. It is complete representation of what the Actor sees in the system:

## Panacloud MVP Coverage (Use Case Driven)

This documents the Use Cases and Wireframes which we will build first.

## GraphQL MVP APIs (Use Case Driven): 

These are the APIs that the wireframes (frontend) call to interact with the backend. This document documents all the GraphQL Schemas for the queries and mutations for each use case:

## Events MVP Design and Schema
A event is a  significant change in state.

## Graph Database MVP Design and Queries (Use Case Driven):

These are designs of a Property Graph Database. In the long-run our plan is to support GQL and Graph Schema Defination ISO standards when they become available, but the implementations are a few years way. Therefore, for now we use openCypher 9 (perfect onramp for GQL) to define the queries and use diagrams to define the graph database schemas.
